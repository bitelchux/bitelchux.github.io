Welcome !
=========

Right Sudoku is the sudoku game implemented with the RightJS JavaScript library.

Basically just a show off case, but nicely done


Building
========

To create a single file build, the project uses the FrontCompiler tool, a ruby
based javascript compressor tool. To create your own builds you need to run
the following commands

  git submodule init && git submodule update
  rake build
